China sends laptops with the system, and it's cheaper than our companies without the system. This is weird. It is also very strange that immediately after receiving the parcel, I, like everyone else, are asked to send a review. What is the review, a laptop without a system, what to write? So far, the laptop is purely outwardly like a laptop, pleasant to the touch, came quickly. That's all for now.
