A good laptop for home use or study. Movies, series, paperwork and phone calls are ideal. The quality of the camera is average, the microphone is good.
One of the main advantages, in my opinion, is the design. The appearance is super-duper, light, almost weightless laptop)) The sound for this price is good, but it could be better)
